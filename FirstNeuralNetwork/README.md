** My First Neural Network with TensorFlow's Sequential API **<br>

This directory contains my first neural network project, which uses TensorFlow's Sequential API to train a model on the MNIST dataset. The goal of this project is to classify handwritten digits using a deep learning model.<br>


**Getting Started**<br>
To run the code, you will need to have the following dependencies installed:<br>
- Tensorflow
- Numpy
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn

You can install these dependencies by running the following command:<br>
`pip install tensorflow numpy matplotlib seaborn` <br>

**Data**<br>

The MNIST dataset is a large dataset of handwritten digits that is commonly used for training and testing image classification models. It is included in the TensorFlow library, so it can be easily loaded and used for training the model.
