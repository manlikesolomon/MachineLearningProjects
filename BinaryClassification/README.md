**Binary Classification with TensorFlow's Sequential API**<br>
This directory contains a binary classification project using TensorFlow's Sequential API. The goal of this project is to classify houses as cheap or expensive based on a number of features using a deep learning model.<br>


**Getting Started**<br>
To run the code, you will need to have the following dependencies installed:
- Numpy
- Pandas
- Seaborn
- Matplotlib <br>

You can install these dependencies by running the following command:<br>
`pip install tensorflow numpy pandas matplotlib seaborn` <br>

**Data**<br>
The california housing dataset was used to train and evaluate or model. A link to import this dataset was provided in the notebook. <br>
