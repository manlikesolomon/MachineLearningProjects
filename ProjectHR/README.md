**Attrition Prediction using Machine Learning (Project HR)**

This project aims to predict the attrition of staff using machine learning techniques in Python.


**Requirements**

The project was built using the following libraries:

- numpy
- pandas
- scikit-learn
- matplotlib
- seaborn

**Data**

The data used in this project is stored in WA_Fn-UseC_-HR-Employee-Attrition.csv. It contains information on 1470 employees with 35 featuires on each employee we will be using to train our model.


**Notebook**

The analysis of the data and the modeling process can be found in the Jupyter Notebook Project HR.ipynb.

**Conclusion**

This project demonstrates the use of classification algorithms like support vector classifier, decision trees and a random forest model to predict employee attrition. 
After training anf hyperparameter tuning, the model is able to make predictions with an accuracy of 93%.
