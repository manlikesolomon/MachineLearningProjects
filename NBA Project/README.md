**NBA MVP Candidate Prediction**<br>
This project is a machine learning project that scrapes "basketball-reference.com" for stats of NBA players from 1991 to 2022, trains a Ridge Regression and Random Forest Model, and uses average precision to evaluate the models in order to predict the top 5 MVP candidates. The project was done as a walk-through with Dataquest.<br>

**Data Collection**<br>
The data for this project was collected from "basketball-reference.com" using web scraping techniques. The data includes various statistics for each player, such as points per game, rebounds per game, assists per game, and more. The data is stored in a Pandas DataFrame and processed to prepare it for modeling.<br>

**Model Training**
The Ridge Regression and Random Forest models are trained using scikit-learn. The models are trained on the processed data and then used to predict the top 5 MVP candidates.<br>

**Model Evaluation**
The models are evaluated using average precision, which is a measure of how well the model is able to rank the true MVP candidates in the list of predictions. The average precision is used to compare the performance of the Ridge Regression and Random Forest models and to determine which model is better at predicting the top 5 MVP candidates.<br>

**Usage**<br>
To run this project, you will need to have the following packages installed:<br>

- pandas
- numpy
- scikit-learn
- BeautifulSoup
- requests
Clone the repository and run the mvp_candidate_prediction.ipynb Jupyter Notebook to see the code and results of the project.
