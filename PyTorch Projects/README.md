**Overview**<br>
This GitHub repository contains a collection of computer vision and machine learning projects implemented using the PyTorch library. The projects in this repository cover a range of topics, including logistic regression, multilayer perceptron, and convolutional neural networks (CNNs).<br>

**Prerequisites**<br>
To run the projects in this repository, you will need the following: <br>
* Python 3.x <br>
* PyTorch library <br>
* NumPy library <br>
* Matplotlib library <br>
* Jupyter Notebook (optional) <br>

**Projects**<br>
1. Logistic Regression <br>
The objective of this project is to implement a binary logistic regression model for classification of images from the MNIST dataset. The model is trained using stochastic gradient descent and achieves an accuracy of over 80%. <br>
2. Multilayer perceptron <br>
The objective of this project is to implement a multilayer perceptron (MLP) for classification of images from the MNIST dataset. The MLP consists of two layers with ReLU activation functions and achieves an accuracy of over 98%.
