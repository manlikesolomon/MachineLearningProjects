**Sentiment Analysis on Twitter Sample Data**<br>

This directory contains a Jupyter notebook that demonstrates the process of sentiment analysis using the Python Natural Language Toolkit (NLTK) library, which I learned from the "Natural Language Processing with Classification and Vector Spaces" course by DeepLearning.AI on Coursera. Sentiment analysis, also known as opinion mining, is a valuable technique for analyzing the sentiment or emotional tone expressed in text data, such as social media posts, customer reviews, and feedback.

In this notebook, I performed sentiment analysis on tweet sample data using various natural language processing techniques, including preprocessing, tokenization, stemming, and logistic regression. The key steps in the notebook include importing the tweet sample data from the NLTK library, performing preprocessing tasks such as removing stop words and punctuations, tokenizing the text, building and training a logistic regressor from scratch, and optimizing the model using gradient descent. Finally, I tested the model with test data to evaluate its performance, achieving an accuracy of 0.995.<br>

**Acknowledgments**<br>
I would like to acknowledge DeepLearning.AI for providing the "Natural Language Processing with Classification and Vector Spaces" course on Coursera, which has helped me learn the concepts and techniques used in this sentiment analysis project. I would also like to thank the NLTK community for providing the tweet sample data and resources for this analysis.<br>

**Conclusion**<br>
Sentiment analysis is a powerful technique for understanding the sentiment expressed in text data, and the Python NLTK library, along with the knowledge gained from the DeepLearning.AI course, provides a rich set of tools for performing this analysis. I hope this notebook serves as a helpful resource for understanding the process of sentiment analysis and implementing it in your own machine learning projects.
