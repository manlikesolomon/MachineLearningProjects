**Overview**<br>
This repository contains a collection of machine learning projects, organized into separate folders for each project. Each project includes code, data, and a brief explanation of the problem and approach used to solve it.<br>

**Project List**<br>
- Binary Classification project: I used Tensorflow to create and evaluate a binary classification model to predict wether houses in a neighborhood are above a certain price based on some features.
- First Neural Network: I trained my first neural network using tensorflow's sequential api to identify numbers from 0 to 9 using the mnist dataset.
- Google Crash Course Neural Network: I recreated the neural network project on google's ML Crash course and used linear regression to predict house prices.
- Support Vector Machines (Introduction): In this project I worked with the support vector machine classifier model on scikit-learn to train various classifiaction models with the different kernels available.
